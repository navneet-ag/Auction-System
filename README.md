# Auction-System using Solidity

We have created a sealed-bid auction system using Solidity, Truffle and React. You can create a new auctions by providing title, starting price, start time and date, end time and date and description of the product to be auctioned using ETH. 

Anyone with the valid cryptocurrency wallet can create and bid on the auction. Only the owner cannot bid on his own auction.

After the auction has ended, the owner can withdraw highest bid and all other bidders can withdraw theie bids.
